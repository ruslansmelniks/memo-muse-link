    transcript: "While walking Max today, I had this thought about starting a community garden in our neighborhood. We have that empty lot on Oak Street that's just sitting there. I should talk to the neighbors about it. Maybe we could grow vegetables and donate some to the local food bank. Also need to remember to pick up dog food on the way home.",

    transcript: "Okay so while I'm doing these dishes I'm thinking about the app idea I had last week. What if there was an app that connected people who have similar random thoughts? Like a social network for stream of consciousness. People could record their thoughts while doing mundane tasks and the AI would find others with similar ideas. Could be called ThoughtMatch or MindWander.",

Need to add a interceptor that catches 401 errors and automatically refreshes before retrying. Also should start training for that half marathon in spring.",
