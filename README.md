git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## How do I build an iOS app?

This project uses Capacitor to wrap the web app into a native iOS shell.

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js 22+ (Capacitor CLI requires Node 22 or newer)
- Xcode (from the App Store)
- CocoaPods (`sudo gem install cocoapods`)

**One-time setup**
```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run cap:add:ios
```

**Sync web changes to iOS**
```sh
npm run build
npm run cap:sync
```

**Open in Xcode**
```sh
npm run cap:open:ios
```

**Development with live reload (optional)**
```sh
CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL="https://your-preview-url" npm run cap:sync
```

If `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL` is set, the iOS app loads that URL. For App Store
builds, keep it unset and ship the bundled `dist/` assets.
